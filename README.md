# KMO_HOMES

Initially developed for a company that manages a portfolio of houses, it has now been repurposed so that it can be used by anyone

You can add your data entry into the bookings list and it will automatically generate a new invoice sheet with the correct information

It will also not add/remove itself from an invoice sheet if that entry isn't needed anymore just by looking at the end date or in the comments section
